# HackerEarth Deep Learning Challenge: Predict The Dance Form
Held online on Mar 21, 2020

## Problem statement
  This International Dance Day, an event management company organized an evening of Indian classical dance performances to celebrate the rich, eloquent, and elegant art of dance. After the event, the company plans to create a microsite to promote and raise awareness among people about these dance forms. However, identifying them from images is a difficult task.

  You are appointed as a Machine Learning Engineer for this project. Your task is to build a deep learning model that can help the company classify these images into eight categories of Indian classical dance.

  Note

  The eight categories of Indian classical dance are as follows:

  Manipuri
  Bharatanatyam
  Odissi
  Kathakali
  Kathak
  Sattriya
  Kuchipudi
  Mohiniyattam

## Data description
  This data set consists of the following two columns:

  Column Name	Description
  Image	Name of Image
  target	Category of Image ['manipuri','bharatanatyam','odissi','kathakali','kathak','sattriya','kuchipudi','mohiniyattam']

  The data folder consists of two folders and two .csv files. The details are as follows:

  train: Contains 364 images for 8 classes ['manipuri','bharatanatyam','odissi','kathakali','kathak','sattriya','kuchipudi','mohiniyattam']
  test: Contains 156 images
  train.csv: 364 x 2
